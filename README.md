## About

Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is a good Architectural Design Pattern to guarantee high cohesion and low coupling between SwiftUI's domain entities. Here is an activity you can start from to learn how to integrate it, thus guaranteeing readability, scalability and re-use. Always take into account that it is not mandatory to use Design Patterns in general, but you may find them useful to use in a certain circumstance.

You should have some preliminary knowledge about Data Modeling, SwiftUI and its property wrappers to be able to go through this activity.

By the end of the activity you should be acquainted to combining the MVVM Pattern in a SwiftUI App.

<br />

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/developer-academy-unina/Workshop-Architectural-Design-Patterns-in-SwiftUI
   ```

2. Open the ```.xcodeproj``` file

### How to

1. Spaghetti App (Starter)

The MVVM Pattern can be useful to set your app with a very powerful structure. In this activity you will move your first steps to master its concept.

- Here you will understand how to separate responsibilities, using ViewModels to exempt the Views from directly manipulating data.
- How to use ViewModels inside Views.
- How to separate SwiftUI Views.
- How to CRUD (Create, read, update and delete) Data in the ViewModels.

2. Spaghetti App (Final)

This is the final result of the Spaghetti App with the MVVM Pattern integration.
